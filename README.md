# MEDP33100 - Project 1 Interactive Storytelling

## Live Demo

[- Include a link to the live version of the project hosted on GitHub Pages.](https://danielm0217.github.io/project1/)

## Project Overview

It's a simple verison of those mobile escape rooms that's done albeit rather crudely but it was an enjoyable project.

## Figma Design

- Provide a link to the Figma design of the webpage.

## Features

- List the key features of the project, including:
    - **Animations**: Describe the animations you implemented (e.g., CSS transitions, GSAP effects).
        An animation on the beginning pop up and while technically not animations I flip between photos to create the illusion of animation through hiding and unhiding images that look like animation through most of my clickables. 
    - **Sound Effects**: Specify where sound effects are used and how they enhance the user experience.
        I try to use sound effects that were relavent to my webpage and able to further enhance immersion which I think I did an okay job at.
    - **User-triggered Events**: Explain how users interact with the page (e.g., clicking, scrolling, hovering) and how the page responds.
        My website mainly deals with the user clicking around and figuring things out. I use pointer cursor to try and point them in the right direction and I use sound to help as well.
    - **Responsive Design**: Explain how the design adapts to different devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
        Too many break points genuinely I think this was arguably the worst part for me that took majority of my time and even now I don't know how I feel about it.

## Technologies Used

- List the technologies and tools used in the project:
    - **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - **Libraries**: (e.g., GSAP for animations)
    - **Other**: GitHub Pages for hosting, Figma for design

## Credits

- List any third-party assets used in the project (e.g., sound effects, images, fonts) and provide proper attribution.
- Acknowledge any resources, tutorials, or references you used to help complete the project.
